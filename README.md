# Durandal Globalization Binding Handlers

Knockout binding handlers for date and numerical objects of the globalization library written in TypeScript. It supports binding dates and numerics to text inputs based on different cultures. These binding handlers were made to be used in conjunction with the Durandal SPA application framework. Since the Durandal framework is no longer being actively developed and has been superseded by Aurelia, this project is also no longer active.
